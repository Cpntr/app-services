This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

on our local first git clone this https://github.com/Cpntr/app-services.git

After cloning, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# app-services
This is a demo of an app that uses the REST API in the Next.js framework to get services. The app allows users to view a list of services, filter them by category, and view details about each service. The app also includes a search bar that allows users to search for services by name.
